# Rust Enum Playground

This repository contains a collection of Rust Enum experiments and code samples. All of the code contained in this repository was written by me and provides an accessible way to explore Rust Enums.

## What is an Enum?
An enum is a type of data structure which allows you to define a set of named constants. This is useful for creating types that represent a finite set of values. For example, an enum representing a set of colors might look like this:

```rust
enum Color {
    Red,
    Green,
    Blue
}
```

## Rust Enum Experiments

This repository contains a collection of experiments and code samples that explore and demonstrate Rust Enums. Each experiment is written in Rust.

## Why Should I Care?

Rust Enums are a powerful tool for creating types that represent a finite set of values. By exploring the experiments in this repository, you will gain a better understanding of how Rust Enums work and how to use them in your own programs. This knowledge will be invaluable to any potential employer looking for a Rust programmer.
